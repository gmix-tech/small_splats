# Small Splats
Sharing our small splats for XR renderer dev.

Clone the repo to download the splats and use them for dev.

We have these splats running at 90 FPS in our internal custom WebXR renderer. 

Our goal is to get a public open-source renderer under Aframe or Three.js.

If you're interested in making your own small splat, you can make one on our [site here](https://www.gmix.ai)
